    "# The Battle of Neighbourhoods\n",
    "### The Problem -\n",
    "In a city, there are a lot of nerighbourhoods. But are all these different from each other or are they the same in some aspects ? If we could answer this question, then it would be really easy for us to decide while moving over to a new area. In this project, we take the case of Toronto and analyze its neighbourhoods.\n",
    "### The Data -\n",
    "For basic information about the neighbourhoods, we can use Wikipedia's data. For information about the facilities in each neighbourhood $FourSquare$'s API can be used. Apart from that, we would need the geo coordinates of the neighbourhoods for which we can use the $geopy$ library in Python."
